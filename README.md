# Flying Etiquette Poll
### Question: Generally speaking, is it rude to say more than a few words to the stranger sitting next to you on a plane?
I chose this question because I was genuinely interested in what the majority of people thought about it. I have seen such different approaches on planes, of people saying nothing to each other, people greeting each other briefly, and of people striking up entire flight-long conversations. I've also seen different reactions to all of these approaches, so it's clearly not something that everyone has agreed on a socially acceptable answer to. The data reveals that the vast majority of people believe it is not rude to say more than a few words to the stranger sitting next to you on a plane, but it is interesting that about a fifth of the number of those that believe it's not rude believe that it is a bit rude.
